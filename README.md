Movie Success Prediction

Problem Statement:

The project aims to predict the revenue/profit generated by a movie.

A variety of factors that are characteristic to every film such as quality of the cast (in terms of recognized skill, popularity and reputation), popularity of the director, budget, genres and keywords associated with movies, are used to understand how these factors contribute toward the gross revenue of the movie.

Data:

  1. Movie Meta Dataset
  2. Hadley Wickhamâ€™s Normalized IMDB Movie Data
  3. Web Scrapping IMDB


Formulation:

Award score = 1*(0.3*OAN + 0.7*EAN) + 4*(0.3*OAW + 0.7*EAW)
Publicity score = Actor Publicity Score = 10*B + 5*M + 1*(I + MA + A)

where,
  OA = Ordinary Award Nominations
  EA = Extraordinary Award (Oscars, Golden Globes, BAFTA) Nominations
  OA = Ordinary Award Wins
  EA = Extraordinary Award (Oscars, Golden Globes, BAFTA) Wins
  The top 3 awards in the film industry Oscars, Golden Globes and BAFTA  were considered and both nominations and wins were     weighted relatively.
  B = Biographies; M = Magazine covers; I = Interviews; MA = Media appearances; A = Articles

Modelling efforts:

Linear Regression to predict square root of Gross.
K-means to cluster movies based on log of profits. Threshold is determined from ROC curve.
Random Forest to determine significant features.
